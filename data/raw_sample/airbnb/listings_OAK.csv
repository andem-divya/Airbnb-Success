Stephanie: 
What a delightful stay I had at this charming home! The location is ideal, as it is 3 blocks away from the Macarthur Bart station, a half a block from my favorite yoga studio (Flying Yoga) and a busy coffee shop, and a few blocks from my favorite restaurant (Burma Superstar) and a 24-hr. Walgreens and so much more. I walked up Telegraph at night several times and I always felt completely safe~ Temescal always seems to be idyllically abuzz with stylish liveliness. Daphne greeted me with such warm friendliness and kept in touch via text message regarding every question I had. She gave me total privacy and assured me that we were not being loud when I would be concerned there was too much stomping or chair moving or dropping things (I never realize how clumsy I am until I have downstairs neighbors!) I had an off-street parking spot and parked my vehicle there full of stuff and it was totally safe. I am grateful for my stay and hope to return someday. Thank you!


Rasham: Definitely recommended - I loved this flat and had a fantastic experience! And Daphne was super welcoming, thoughtful and nice. I stayed here while I was visiting my family locally. I had to be in downtown San Francisco the following day and it literally took me less than 15 minutes to get to downtown San Francisco door-to-door! Win!! I was already familiar with the Temescal neighborhood, so I knew about all the amazing restaurants and cool shops within walking distance, including my two favorites - Pizzaolo and Dona Tomas. This flat is right in the center of everything - the listing is accurate, it is very centrally located and was very easy to use as a base, between getting to San Francisco, and my family in the East Bay. The flat itself is beautiful - I loved the hardwood floors and it has a very spacious feel. And Daphne was super nice and very responsive. I would definitely stay here again!

Janina: This place is awesome! The apartment is just around the corner from public transit, and is in a great neighborhood-- vibrant community, fantastic food, and beautiful streets and homes. The apartment is great-- super spacious, tons of natural light, awesome back yard, beautifully decorated and very comfortably furnished. Daphne was an excellent host-- very communicative, thoughtful, receptive, and welcoming. I loved staying here and would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone visiting Oakland!

Steven: I stayed for 3 days and overall great experience. The neighborhood is extremely safe and had tons of great restaurants (American, Korean, etc.). The listing was also close by the BART, less than a 5 min walk and 20 min into SF.
