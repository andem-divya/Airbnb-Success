It is located within the urban region of western Los Angeles County known as the Westside.<br /><br />Venice was founded in 1905 as a seaside resort town. It was an independent city until 1926, when it merged with Los Angeles. Today, Venice is known for its canals, beaches, and the circus-like Ocean Front Walk, a two-and-a-half-mile (4.0 km) pedestrian promenade that features performers, fortune-tellers, artists and vendors. In the latter half of the 2010s, the neighborhood has faced severe gentrification that raised real-estate prices and pushed out many long-term inhabitants.<br /><br />Venice is a colorful community full of locals and tourists alike.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/2836989/5c024e12_original.jpg,998027,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/998027,Helen,2011-08-20,"Los Angeles, CA","i wouldn't choose to live any where else in los angeles.  i am a young professional and the house is full of just that.  there are 8 separate units in a cool house from the late 1920's. my home is my sanctuary so i keep it tidy and full of everything i need.  i have books for you to read (i hope you like my selection).   i have all sorts of cooking supplies for those that love to cook as much as i do.  there is a great space to sit outside with a table and chairs available on the porch for those beautiful LA days.  and the wireless internet works out there so you can even work outside if you choose.  i have a skateboard you can use, which can be super helpful and a fun way to see Venice and Santa Monica or Marina Del Rey.  i am all about community and i think you will soon fall in love with Venice just as i have.  :) i love to ride my Bianchi around town, hit up my local coffee shop (Menotti's), go to the beach, with a good book, play with my friends and (mostly) i love to eat out at all the great restaurants LA has to offer.  i will leave you some recommendations for you to check out upon arrival.

Shared bathroom. Shared kitchen. Living room / studio / common area. The area is very close to some of the best hiking in California, as well as easy driving distance to Malibu and surfing. Exactly 33 miles from Downtown. Awesome grocery stores and all necessary services are near-by.","IMPORTANT<br /><br />This is one of the nicest suburban bedroom communities in LA. Less than a mile from gated communities where the likes of the Kardashians and Justin Beiber and Drake live. <br /><br />HOWEVER, the triplex, although convenient in its location, is on a very gritty street near a commercial zone and directly adjacent to the 101 Freeway. <br /><br />As such, the freeway is audible during the day...about the same as street traffic is audible within any loft in Downtown LA...but much less so, than say, the sound of waves while camping at the ocean. It quiets down significantly at night...but it isn't totally silent. <br /><br />Air quality ain't horrible, but not as refreshing, say, as being on top of the Rocky Mountains. Again, it's comparable to being at street level in Downtown LA. (The air is nicer on adjacent trails and closer to the ocean.)<br /><br />For weird geographic reasons, this neighborhood is famous for being the warmest neighborhood in LA during late summer",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-287630/original/52b70042-38cb-4ab4-a32f-4fcd55bf80c5.jpeg,1496160,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/1496160,Sean,2011-12-12,"Los Angeles, CA","I make music for a living, and have been doing that for a long, long time.  I'm increasingly also involved with stuff related to the web.  As a result, I've met a lot of very interesting people from all walks of life, and, likewise, so far, I have been fortunate enough to be leading a life rich in experience...(or so I like to think!)  Although my work as a performer and producer has frequently put me in settings surrounded with relative opulence, I, personally, live a very modest life, and my apartment reflects that.  I like where I presently live.  I think you'll like it, too.  It's not huge, nor appointed with swanky decor, but it's quiet, and convenient to a lot of cool things.  If you're into privacy, I can dig it...and am happy to leave you alone.  If you're looking for a locally acquainted host full of interesting convo...then look no further.  I think you'll be glad you met me.  

Since I'm new to Airbnb, what I need from you to book the room...just two things:

1) I need something--anything--on your profile that let's me know you're a real person.  Just signed up?  Don't have a phone?  Don't have any of the popular social networking profiles or a LinkedIn profile connected to your account? Don't have a photo, just the avatar? Things like that make me slightly more sketched out when it comes to being a host. Keep in mind, my apartment isn't a Motel 6; it's my home. I actually live here sometimes, and my stuff is here. And, so, in the spirit of openness and reciprocality (is that a word?), I'd like to have a teeny-tiny sense of who you are before I open up my home for your use.   If I know a little about what you're hoping to enjoy while here in L.A., and/or have a sense of who you are--like even just your name, that you're here on business or vacation, or that you're originally from city XYZ or went to school at the University of ABC--whatever you feel like sharing....just the slightest inkling about you, and then I think--or hope--it'll be less awkward for both of us, don't you think?  I don't need to read your life story.  Essentially: I just need to have a vibe that I'm entrusting the use of my home to a reasonable human being.  The only way I can vibe that out is simply by reading your profile on Airbnb.

So, please, write a sentence or two about yourself on your Airbnb profile, post a photo, or give me at least the vaguest notion that you're part of the Airbnb community...and then, yes, please, come on over!  You'll have carte blanche. Mi casa is su casa.

2) I need two days notice.  L.A. is a big area, and, as a working musician, I'm all over the place, and sometimes I work whacky hours...sooo: I need a little bit of a heads-up to get things ready for your arrival.  Feel free to ask, but--more often than not--I cannot accommodate same day bookings.  It's not impossible, but probably not likely. Again, feel free to ask if you like, however...

Finally, an IMPORTANT NOTE: If you're new to Airbnb, please understand I cannot contact you directly.  You must use Airbnb to communicate with me, and I must use Airbnb to communicate with you.  If you include your phone number in your e-mails or texts to me, Airbnb will erase or obscure your number.  I will not be able to call you.  Nor can I include my phone in an e-mail or text to you.  I can see your phone only after we have a confirmed booking, but not before.  So, I cannot answer your questions in advance of a booking by calling you.  

I hope that helps!
