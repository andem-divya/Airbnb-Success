Traveling is one of my passions. I love cities with souls: Paris, Cape Town, Istanbul, Bombay and London are my favourite cities though San Francisco is where I feel most at home.  When I travel I like to get a handle on the vibe of a city - its history, its people, what moves it. What moves *them*. And that's what I like to share about San Francisco with visitors. 

Even if you stay somewhere else - feel free to ask me about what to do in the city, where to eat or memorable places for a coffee or a drink.

Both of us are career media professionals who have joyfully  transitioned to working in community arts organizations.  

We have visited many places in the U.S. and abroad  and our many travel experiences have given us great insight in how to host. We have always enjoyed staying in private spaces to get a feel for how the locals live. On our travels we have enjoyed cooking our own meals as well as eating out. Hopefully our guests will benefit from what we've learned along the way about hospitality and comfort. 

Our hosting style is service-oriented but not intrusive, where your privacy and comfort is our priority. We live on the premises, above the suite and are always available to help our guests have the best stay possible.  We look forward to meeting you!
