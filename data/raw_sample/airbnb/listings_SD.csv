And, my devoted step-daughter is a professor at several local colleges...both following me into rewarding the field of education.

I have a small import business selling items mostly from Thailand.  This started when I returned with some bamboo purses that I could not carry without a compliment.  I soon added a succulent art component when buyers asked to purchase the plants I brought along to adorn my sales displays.  So, now I enjoy creating and selling succulent art using cuttings from my garden and my neighboring canyon.  The most popular items are currently those planted in shoes I find at second hand stores.  I have just been asked to create some pieces for a wedding for a second time.  This time I will be using martini glasses filled with jewels and succulents.  I love the creative experience as much as the added income!

I know what it is like to rent and share share one's accommodations.  I often travel by making house exchanges using the Intervac agency.  I rent my upstairs home when I'm away and the downstairs vacation rental apartment most of the time.  
I have been told that I am an easy guest.  I am low maintenance and usually find that humor is a good companion and tool.  The only food that I absolutely dislike is licorice!  I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner and so have my mind open to a wide range of books, music, movies and life experiences.  I have recently added sailing to my life experiences.  My dear partner, Tom, and I sailed his boat from San Diego to Seattle and now enjoy many opportunities to sail the San Juan islands on The Black Swan. We recently added a 43 foot ketch sailboat to our fun while in San Diego and offer sunset sails through Airbnb experiences.
